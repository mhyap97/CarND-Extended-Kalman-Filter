# CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-P1
Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Extended Kalman Filter Implementation

# Overview
This project consists of implementing an [Extended Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter) with C++. A simulator provided by Udacity ([it could be downloaded here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)) generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object, and the Extended Kalman Filter[EKF] must fusion those measurements to predict the position of the object. The communication between the simulator and the EKF is done using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) using the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) implementation on the EKF side.
To get this project started, Udacity provides a seed project that could be found (here)(https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project).

# Prerequisites

The project has the following dependencies (from Udacity's seed project):

- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4
- Udacity's simulator.

For instructions on how to install these components on different operating systems, please, visit [Udacity's seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project). As this particular implementation was done on Mac OS, the rest of this documentation will be focused on Mac OS. I am sorry to be that restrictive.

In order to install the necessary libraries, use the [install-mac.sh](./install-mac.sh).

# Compiling and executing the project

These are the suggested steps:

- Clone the repo and cd to it on a Terminal.
- Create the build directory: `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`: This will create two executables
  - `ExtendedKF` : EKF implementation.
  
The code presented here is designed to work with the Udacity term 2 simulation executable, and so cannot be run standalone. However, here's some example output.

![Tracking car with EKF][ekf_example]

Red circles are lidar measurements.

Blue circles are radar measurements (position markers inferred from radius and angle; 
the also-supplied radial velocity measurements are not shown).

Green markers are the car's position as estimated by the Kalman filter.
It's clear that the Kalman filter does a good job of tracking the car's 
position with significantly reduced noise.
